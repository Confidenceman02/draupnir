###The Client
Caleb and Brown is a brokering business that purchases crypto currency on behalf of their clients. In essence, a client makes contact with 
Caleb and Brown and informs them how much fiat money they wish to convert to crypto. Caleb and Brown go through a KYC procedure and then
purchase those coins on their clients behalf, typically on international exchanges.
Market analysis is essential for our clients to get the best price for the crypto, as it differs, sometimes quite dramatically.
###The Problem
Our clients have manually been analysisng the price of crypto as well as hand crafting quotes for their clients. On top of this our clients
have no efficient way of keeping a history of purchases they make on their clients behlaf. The actual purchasing of crypto currency from
foreign echanges is also done manually. Whilst this process can be automated by Draupnir, we felt it best to not do automatic transfers
given the immaturity of the software.
